<h2><a name="THE_REMEDY_BUT_WHO_IS_TO_FURNISH_IT" id="THE_REMEDY_BUT_WHO_IS_TO_FURNISH_IT"></a>THE REMEDY&mdash;BUT WHO IS TO FURNISH IT?</h2>


<p>President Harrison's Inaugural gives in a brief sentence the remedy for
the great Southern difficulty, viz. EDUCATION.</p>

<p>"If, in any of the States, the public security is thought to be
threatened by ignorance among the electors, the obvious remedy is
education."</p>

<p>The Southern situation has been vigorously discussed in the last few
months on the platform, and in the magazines and newspapers, and the
conclusion to which the minds of thoughtful men is rapidly coming is
that announced in the President's Message.</p>

<p>But the remedy will not apply itself, and the means for an adequate
supply of educational facilities must be furnished promptly or the time
will soon come when the case will be hopeless.</p>


<h4>WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF THIS SUPPLY?</h4>

<p>1. The public school funds of the States themselves. This must be the
main source. We recognize the fact that the Southern States are
comparatively poor, and the further fact, so greatly to their credit,
that some of them are paying as large a per cent. on the assessed value
of their property as do some of the Northern States. But all the same,
the supply of school houses and teachers is utterly inadequate.</p>

<p>2. From the National Government. The Government has done something in
this direction; in giving lands to the States for educational purposes
and in establishing the Freedmen's Bureau. It is urged to do more by the
passage of an Educational Bill. It has been said that there are
objections to every possible way of planting a hill of corn. But a good
deal of corn has been planted, and it grows. There are objections to any
possible Educational Bill that can be framed. Some of the funds will be
wasted, some will be expended in favoritism and some will be neglected
and not expended at all. But yet a large share of the money will be
spent and well spent, and the great good will over-balance the minor
evils. But even the appropriation, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>under any Educational Bill that has
been proposed, will be but a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>3. Another source is from Northern charitable funds. The North owes an
immeasurable debt to both races in the South. It emancipated the slave,
and in so doing, assumed its share of the responsibility for the
consequences. It cannot shrink from the duty under the plea that it is a
Southern question, or even because some of the people at the South
protest against its interference.</p>

<p>The duty of the North is two-fold&mdash;educational and religious. It is
bound to aid in primary, industrial, normal and higher education. It has
the teachers and it has the money. It has a special obligation to impart
<i>religious</i> instruction. The public school funds of the South and the
money of the National Government cannot be applied to distinctively
religious education. But there is no such restriction on the Northern
schools in the South; they can give religious instruction in all
departments, and they can train up religious teachers and preachers. The
North, too, has an urgent call to found pure and intelligent churches
among the masses in the South.</p>

<p>The North has not been idle in these respects. The public in both
sections of the country have, we believe, a faint conception of the
amount of money already expended in the South by Northern charitable
individuals and societies. For example, the American Missionary
Association, including some institutions which it founded and for a time
sustained, has expended $7,124,151.26; and including, also, books and
clothing and the amount collected and spent in connection with its
boarding departments, the total sum, as near as can be computed, would
be not far from <i>ten millions of dollars</i> since 1862; and this money has
been economically and wisely expended. It is due to the Association and
to those who have supplied it with the funds, that the grandeur of its
work should be recognized. But, if now, to all this is added the amount
expended in the South by other religious bodies and by the Peabody and
Slater and Hand funds, it will be seen that a mighty force is at work,
unobtrusive as it is helpful, arousing no antagonism in the South, and
blessing in its rebound the benevolent contributors at the North.</p>


<h4>THE INADEQUACY OF THE SUPPLY.</h4>

<p>But, as the disciples said in regard to the five barley loaves and the
two fishes, "<i>What are these among so many?</i>" The means in both cases
are utterly inadequate, and the need of multiplying is as imperative
here as it was on the shore of Galilee. We have a Negro population of
eight millions, which has doubled in the last twenty years, and
increases at the rate of six hundred per day&mdash;requiring, if adequately
supplied, the founding of a new Fisk University or Talladega College
every twenty-four hours. There are 1,500,000 illiterate voters in the
South, and how can the North, while admitting with President Harrison,
that if the public security is threatened <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>by this ignorance the remedy
is education, withhold its share of the necessary means?</p>

<p>How can the churches of the North, who know that the future destiny of
these ignorant masses depends upon their <i>religious</i> far more than upon
their secular education, refuse the needed gifts for that purpose? Here
is where the miracle wrought on the shore of Galilee needs to be
repeated. Our Lord and Master is not here now in bodily presence, and he
entrusts to his church the duty of multiplying the bread of life for
these vast perishing masses. The churches of the North must awake to
this great duty. If done at all, it must be done promptly. Present means
are wholly inadequate. Every individual Christian at the North should
feel his personal responsibility and should respond by a great increase
of his contributions for this purpose. It is not too much to say that
the religious influences sent from the North in school, in industrial
training, in the preparation of Christian ministers and teachers, and in
the planting of Christian churches, will well-nigh constitute the
pivotal point of the whole movement. A loss now can never be regained,
but the achievements of the present should be a stimulus for the future.
The North withheld neither treasure nor blood to save the Union and to
free the slave. Treasure and toil will now save the South and the
Nation.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SOME_CURIOUS_AND_SUGGESTIVE_FACTS" id="SOME_CURIOUS_AND_SUGGESTIVE_FACTS"></a>SOME CURIOUS AND SUGGESTIVE FACTS.</h2>

<p>What proportion of the funds contributed by living donors to missionary
societies comes directly from church collections? We presume the answer
from a large majority of the contributors would be, three-fourths or
four-fifths. But the curious fact is, that, for the three years, 1886,
1887 and 1888, the average contributions to the American Missionary
Association from church collections are forty-seven per cent., from
Sunday-schools seven per cent., from Woman's Missionary Societies five
per cent., from individual donors forty-one per cent. It thus appears
that less than one-half the total sum comes from collections in the
churches. Another curious fact is, that these receipts directly from the
churches are uniform, not differing to the extent of three per cent. in
the past three years. So that, with all the importunity and pressure,
the plate collections in the churches have not increased.</p>

<p>Another curious fact is, that one-third of the amount donated by
individuals is for special objects, mainly for the increase of plant,
and thus adds to the cost of running expenses, and is so far forth a
burden and not a relief on regular appropriations for current expenses.</p>

<p>What, therefore, is the stable reliance of missionary societies on which
to make annual appropriations? It cannot be on legacies. It cannot be on
the special contributions of individuals. It ought to be based on church
collections. These should carry current expenses, and the additional
plant should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>come from outside sources. If this be so, and the societies
are to increase their work at all from year to year; if, indeed, they
are to meet the additional cost of the new plant given by individuals,
then the church collections should be increased proportionately.</p>

<p>Are we not, therefore, making a legitimate appeal, when we urge upon
every church member the duty of increasing his individual gift put into
the plate when the collection is taken? A vote of the National Council
or of the Annual Meeting of a missionary body, or of a State Conference,
that a society should receive an increase of funds amounts to little,
unless the individual donor in the church will increase his gifts.</p>

<p>A little increase here aggregates much. If every member will add five
per cent. or ten per cent., it will be little to each, but will be great
in the total. May we ask our readers to lay this to heart with the query
of each to himself, "Is it not <i>my</i> duty to increase my individual
contribution?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="PARAGRAPHS" id="PARAGRAPHS"></a>PARAGRAPHS.</h2>

<p>We have many appeals by letter and in person from colored people in the
South, for help from the Hand Fund, to aid in sustaining enterprises
which these people are endeavoring to carry forward. Some of these
schools are heavily in debt. Others are greatly lacking in necessary
facilities, buildings, furniture and teachers. Others are crippled for
want of means to meet current expenses. Many of these institutions are
unwisely located, others have no adequate financial basis to warrant
their existence, and some seem to lack the necessary provision for
supervision and responsibility. Taken all together, they furnish
additional warnings to the people of the North against contributing to
individual or local enterprises in the South without most careful
scrutiny into the facts in each individual instance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A colored missionary teacher in one of the most desolate parts of North
Carolina writes us as follows:</p>

<p>"In making out my bill, you will perhaps not understand what I mean by
the amount to be 'deducted.' I desire to give one-tenth of all my
earnings to God. Of course it is His by right. Our missionary has
brought the matter plainly before me, so I desire that you will deduct
$2.00 every month, which will be one-tenth of my entire salary, and put
it where it will be used for the service of Christ."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Rev. Frank G. Woodworth writes from Tougaloo University.</p>

<p>The school is progressing well. If we have the necessary accommodations,
I see no reason why the school should not enrol 500 pupils within the
next two years. We have had nearly 340 thus far, and probably will reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>375 by the end of the year, and we have refused between 30 and 40 girls
because we had no room for them.</p>

<p>In the last MISSIONARY we gave quite an account of special religious
services held in connection with the Le Moyne Institute, Memphis, Tenn.
In the brief extract below, from a letter of Prof. Steele's, we see some
pleasant results:</p>

<p>"Our special meetings in connection with Mr. Wharton's stay of two weeks
are closed. There have been some eighty or more conversions in church
and school; over sixty are students in school. The work seems very
genuine."</p>

<p>The announcement of the winners of the Tunis Quick prize for grammar and
spelling has been made by the faculty of Rutgers College. The prize was
equally divided between James E. Carr of New York City, and Milton
Demarest of Oredell, N.J. Carr is colored. Last year he took the highest
honor at the grammar school commencement, delivering the valedictory and
winning a prize scholarship. He has only one eye.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_FROM_NEW_ENGLAND" id="NOTES_FROM_NEW_ENGLAND"></a>NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>I recently spoke in a manufacturing town in New England. In the forenoon
service, a man, evidently an operative in one of the mills, sat in a
front pew with a whole row of little children beside him, his wife at
the end of the line with a baby in her lap. In the evening, the same man
and family, minus the mother and baby, occupied the same pew. After the
service, this man came to me, and with deep emotion said: "I am only a
working man; you saw my large family of little children; every penny I
can earn counts, but I feel that I must divide the living of my children
with these poor people you have told us of to-day. We can get on with
poorer food to give them the gospel."</p>

<p>This was said in the accent that told that this Christian nobleman came
from old covenant-making and covenant-keeping Scotland! Not a very
"dangerous foreigner!" Money given from such extreme sacrifice is
sacred. Would this spirit were universal!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The close relation existing between the work of the American Missionary
Association for the colored people in America, and that of the American
Board for the colored people in Africa, is most interestingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>illustrated by a contribution which has recently reached this New
England office. Rev. B.F. Ousley of Kambini, East Africa, sends a
contribution of ten dollars for the Theological Department in Fisk
University, Nashville, Tenn. Mr. Ousley and wife are graduates of Fisk
University and went out as missionaries to Africa under the American
Board, four years ago. After these years of experience they realize that
Africa must be evangelized by colored people trained by A.M.A. schools,
and they make this generous contribution to this grand work.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A suggestion made in the Boston "Ministers' Meeting," on the question,
"How to conduct a prayer meeting," might be very appropriately applied
to missionary concerts and addresses. This was the suggestion: "Keep the
temperature warm, the atmosphere clear, and don't pommel the
Christians!" Applied to missionary concerts and addresses, this sound
advice would read: Keep the missionary temperature warm by telling
incidents of missionary experience; keep the missionary atmosphere clear
by presenting the grand hopefulness of the glorious work, and don't
pommel those who attend these meetings and give to these causes!</p>

<p>Patriotism is all aglow among the boys and girls of New England just
now! More than twelve hundred have enlisted recently in the army of the
"True Blues." Pastors, Sunday-school superintendents and teachers,
officers of Young People's Societies of Christian Endeavor, and other
missionary societies have been the enthusiastic recruiting sergeants,
and still there is demand for more recruits. Who will enlist next?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the last "Notes from New England," we recorded the gift of an aged
friend. Now comes this touching letter:</p>

<p>"Dear Sir:&mdash;Please find enclosed $5.00 for the A.M. Association, the
Christmas present of a son to a father. The father is eighty-one years
old to-day. He has been with the A.M.A. from its organization, and
wishes its continued prosperity until its great work is accomplished.</p>

<p>Is there any work, North or South, at home or abroad, that requires more
versatile gifts or breadth of training than the work of this
Association? Here are a few lines from the letter of a missionary in
Alabama, which illustrate the many-sidedness of this work:</p>

<p>"I have organized a Woman's Missionary Society. I have an industrial
class for girls, and give them instruction in sewing, in housework on
the principle of the kitchen-garden system, without the practice, as I
have not the articles to use for that purpose. Then a lesson from the
Bible, also, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>comes in, and some amusement in the way of puzzles. The
girls are pleased to belong to a society of King's Daughters. I have a
class for instructing the women in darning, patching, button-hole making
and so on. We have a Society of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union
in which I have the Department of Social Purity.</p>

<p>"You will be able to believe that my time is pretty fully occupied. I
rejoice that I am able to be here, for I am never so happy as when I am
engaged in this beloved work."</p>

<p>Is not here a splendid field for missionary work for the King's
Daughters throughout the land? Why cannot the loyal daughters of the
King, at the North, support such missionaries as this in their
self-sacrificing work for the down-trodden daughters of this same Divine
King in the South?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the communication below, an esteemed friend finds in our
Annual Meeting at Providence an object-lesson in the Christian
recognition of the colored man, which he very properly sets over
against a like example in the convention of colored Roman
Catholics recently held in Washington, D.C. Our friend is right.
The American Missionary Association stands square on that
subject. We only wish that everybody else, even at the North,
stood with us on that plank of our platform.</p></div>

<p>"In THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY for February, 1889, I read extracts and
notices from Catholic sources with regard to the universality of that
church organization that 'knows neither North, South, East or West, that
knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek, Barbarian nor Scythian,' and
emphasizing the fact that a colored priest had celebrated mass in
company with two white clergymen.</p>

<p>"I am thus reminded of the Annual Meeting of one of the most prominent
national organizations of a religious nature in our land. A few months
ago in the city of Providence, in one of the finest churches of that or
of any city in our land, before as refined and cultivated an audience as
could have been convened in our country, addresses were made by colored
men who sat in the pulpit with some of the most distinguished white
clergymen in the country. If one is an object-lesson, is not the other
quite as much so?"</p>

<p>DEBATE.&mdash;<i>Resolved, that Arithmetic is better than Grammar.</i></p>

<p>Affirmative: "Arithmetic is better, because without it we could not buy
or sell anything, build houses, bridges or railroads, measure lands or
even count. Can a man make money by knowing the grammar? Ain't no sense
in grammar noway. It's always been my experience that</p>

<span class="i2">All for the white man and none for the nigger.'"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Negative: "To prove that grammar is better, take the Tower of Babble.
They built it, I suppose, many miles high, and the Lord looked down and
mixed up their grammar. So if a man was on top of the tower he would
call down, 'John, bring up the hammer,' and John would come up with a
saw. Then he would send him down for the hammer again, and John would
bring up the nails. How much could we learn of religion, of history and
the world around us, if it were not for grammar? Would 1-2-3 tell us all
that?"</p>

<p>But I have not left much room to tell about the good side. Many of the
papers, for neatness, accuracy and clear expression, would do credit to
any children in the world. Especially is this true of the younger
pupils, who have received the training of the lower grades of the
school. One essay on Slavery, by a member of the Ninth Year Class,
written in two days, contained twenty pages, with scarcely an
unnecessary word, and very few mistakes. I wish you could hear some of
the sensible talks in prayer-meetings, and fervent prayers for
classmates, teachers, and the kind people at the North who are trying to
help them.</p>

could, and as <i>he</i> was the only man in the house who had a devil, if he
would come up to the stand, I would cast the devil out of him. The
conjurer abused me terribly, became so excited I started down towards
him, and dared him to meet me, and he turned from me and ran out of the

him and the devil out of the house."</p>

proceedings of one of the most remarkable Missionary Conferences ever
held in the world. The addresses, papers and discussions emanated not
from theorists, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>but from men actually engaged in the management of the
great missionary organizations of Christendom, or who were actively

Atlantic, by travelers, and by students of the progress of the church in
modern times. The possessor of these volumes will have a treasury of

<p><br /><i>The Path to Wealth.</i> By A BLACKSMITH, B.F. Johnson &amp; Co., Richmond, Va.</p>

<p>This is a unique book. It purports to give the addresses of a practical
blacksmith, some of them delivered in his shop to a few neighbors, but
the audience becoming larger, the rest were given in an adjacent church
building. To most persons, the title affords a slight clue to the drift
of the book, which is to show the duty and the benefits of giving the
tithe of a man's income to the Lord. The author's bottom thought is
based on this statement in the preface: "God pledges himself for the
success of that individual who renders obedience to the divine
money-claim." In other words, the path to wealth is the path of
benevolence. The obligation to give the tithe is earnestly enforced by
the ordinary Scripture quotations, and by arguments drawn from other
sources. Whatever the reader may think of the theory of the book, he
will find in it a good deal of valuable and practical truth.</p>


<p><br /><i>Yale Lectures on the Sunday-school.</i> By H. CLAY TRUMBULL. Philadelphia:

soon be given to the public. Such an author in such a presence and with

<h4>MRS. LIVA A. SHAW.</h4>

<p>The dedication of Ballard Building took place Thursday, February 14th.
The services were attended by a large number of the patrons and friends
of the school, among the latter some of the leading white citizens of
Macon. After the opening exercises, short addresses were made by Prof.
Zettler, Superintendent of Bibb Co. schools, Dr. Greene, a leading
colored physician, and the following city pastors; Dr. Warren, First
Baptist; Dr. Jennings, First Presbyterian, and Mr. Miller, Washington
Avenue Presbyterian, (Colored). These were followed by Corresponding
Secretary Dr. Beard, of New York.</p>

<p>The music was appropriate and beautiful, and made a deep impression upon
some of our white friends, who were both pleased and surprised. Prof.
Zettler gave expression to his interest in all educational matters in
this county, and renewed his assurances of good will and gratitude if he
can do even a little to help on a good cause.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren said that he had known this school and church through all its
past history, having been present at the dedication of the old church
twenty years ago. He has watched the growth, and considered the
character of the influence here exerted, and so far as he can judge, it
has been, and is, elevating. He spoke of the value of a practical
education, and he said he could trust these Yankees with their skill and
energy to make the training they are giving in this school eminently
practical. He expressed gratitude for the privilege he has had of
knowing and loving a number of teachers and pastors engaged in labor
here, and he invoked the divine blessing upon all these consecrated
women who have left their homes and friends to do this work among the
poor and needy.</p>

<p>Dr. Jennings spoke to the young people of the need of a high aim and
firm purpose in accomplishing any important work in life. His words were
full of inspiration to the young men and women who heard him. He stood
upon the broad platform of Christian brotherhood, and while he
congratulated the American Missionary Association upon the grand work
being done, he especially congratulated the citizens of Macon, all of
whom are reaping the benefits of this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>Dr. Greene's message was one of counsel and instruction for his own
people. He dwelt upon the generosity of the donor of this beautiful
building with its furnishings, the improved facilities afforded for
teaching, and the great need of a higher appreciation of the benefits
thus brought within the reach of a larger number than ever before. He
deprecated the common attempt to solve the Negro problem by stirring up
discontent among the people, and making them dissatisfied with present
conditions, unless a remedy is recommended and placed within their
reach. He looked upon every Christian school in the South, every man or
woman who walks uprightly and deals honestly, as helping to the only
true solution of the Negro problem. He rejoiced in the raising of the
standard of fitness to teach, on the part of the County Superintendent.
His words had the ring of successful, manly effort in them, and
commanded the respectful attention of all his hearers.</p>

<p>After returning thanks to Mr. Ballard for his noble gift, which brought
the assembly together, to Messrs. Pettit and DeHaven for the fidelity
with which they have wrought, to Prof. Zettler for his counsel, and to
the Christian friends who have helped and encouraged the work by their
sympathy, Dr. Beard gave an address full of information, concerning the
work of the American Missionary Association, its aims, encouragements,
and results. He emphasized the importance of making a right use of
blessings, and spoke of the danger that attends all effort to help
others, that it may become a hindrance instead of a help, according to
the way in which it is received. He left a well-defined impression that
it is the aim of the organization which he represents so to supplement
the efforts of those who are trying to help themselves, that true
independent manhood and womanhood shall be developed. He then introduced
the subject of a change of name for Lewis Normal Institute. He stated
that it was with the hearty concurrence of Gen. Lewis that he now
announced that this school should be henceforth known as BALLARD NORMAL
SCHOOL.</p>

<p>When Dr. Beard closed, Mr. Furcron, President of the Macon Sunday School
Union, (Colored,) rose and made a motion in behalf of the colored people
of Macon, that a rising vote of thanks be tendered to Mr. Ballard for
this beautiful building and its convenient and tasteful furnishings. Dr.
Warren made a special request that the franchise be extended so as to
include the white friends present, that all might vote. It was responded
to by the whole assembly's rising. After the benediction, the various
rooms were visited and admired. The beauty and convenience of the rooms,
the fine pictures on the walls, the beautiful desks and chairs for the
teachers, the elegant Steinway piano, the bell, and the handsome stoves,
were all noted and heartily commended.</p>

<p>The day passed off pleasantly with but one regret, viz; that Mr. Ballard
was not with us to share in our joy and to let us all see his happiness
in doing good to others.</p>

<h2><a name="TEN_YEARS_AT_THE_FRONT" id="TEN_YEARS_AT_THE_FRONT"></a>TEN YEARS AT THE FRONT.</h2>

<h4>BY REV. STANLEY B. LATHROP.</h4>

<p>The month of November, 1888, completed the cycle of ten years of my
active service in the work of the American Missionary Association. They
have been years of intense interest and great enjoyment. Ten years of
study, four in the army, and eight years of pastoral labor in Wisconsin
preceded; but of all these marked periods, none have been more truly
enjoyable and fruitful than these last ten years of preaching the gospel
to the poor. It has been my good fortune to visit at various times most
of the prominent points in the work of the Association in the South,
both in the colored and in the mountain white departments.</p>

<p>And so, from this decennial standpoint of experience and observation, I
want to put on record a few thoughts which have been simmering in my
mind.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;The vast importance and far-reaching influence of the work that has
been done. From all these schools and churches, scattered through this
Southland, there have come forth, year by year, hundreds of young
colored men and women, whose minds have been disciplined and characters
deeply impressed for a good life. Thousands have gone out to teach and
labor among their own people, with hearts aflame with true missionary
zeal. They have labored among innumerable trials and discouragements, in
leaky, rickety log-cabins, without desks, without blackboards, maps,
charts, or other educational necessities. They have been eager and
zealous workers for Sunday-schools, for temperance and righteous living,
even when oftentimes opposed by the old-time preachers and
church-officers of their own race, and sometimes opposed by the whites.
So the leaven has spread far and wide. A great work has been accomplished
by these schools and churches. These ten years have seen a most decided
uplifting of character and power among the colored race. They are
steadily acquiring property, building homes and improving their
surroundings. There are now over eighty newspapers published by colored
men in the former slave States of the South. Some of these are very
creditable specimens in typography and in ability, and they have great
and increasing influence. The great majority of these editors and
teachers have been educated in the A.M.A. schools. There are also
several colored lawyers, dentists and physicians, who have almost
without exception been educated in our schools. The direct results in
our Congregational church work are not as plainly apparent, because most
of the students when coming under our influence are already connected
with other churches, or else their parents are, which amounts almost to
the same thing. So the Baptists and Methodists have reaped rich harvests
through the training of their sons and daughters in our schools. But
these same denominations have been through this means greatly uplifted
and purified, so that great good has come to all these strong and
numerous churches, besides the steady <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>growth of Congregationalism as
well. Rev. Dr. Curry, one of the leaders of Southern thought, said in a
recent address before the Georgia Legislature, "The Congregationalists
have done more than all other denominations for the education of the
Negro&mdash;they have done grandly, patriotically." To my eyes, which have
been wide open during these ten years, there are most marked and
gratifying signs of progress apparent in every way. Far and near the
leaven has spread, the older denominations are improving, the principles
of industrial and Christian education are accomplishing untold good.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;There is also manifest in these ten years a marked improvement in
the feeling between the races. When a man has lived for ten years in the
South, he will begin to see how deeply rooted and immovably imbedded in
the Southern mind is the sentiment of inborn contempt for the Negro.
This was greatly intensified and brought to the surface by the passions
and prejudices of the war, with the volcanic upheavals and chaotic
events of the "carpet-bag period" which followed. Considering all these
things, there has been in my opinion a remarkable loosening of the grasp
of prejudice, a gradual melting of the caste principle, especially in
the minds of the better class among the whites. I say this deliberately,
with personal knowledge of the agitation of the infamous "Glenn Bill" in
Georgia, and notwithstanding the prejudice in Alabama which broke up the
colored normal school formerly existing in Marion, and afterward
successfully opposed its re-establishment in Montgomery, or rather
refused the previous State aid. Having been for many years on the Board
of Trustees of Atlanta University, and being personally acquainted with
a number of the members of the Georgia Legislature, yet I am prepared to
state this astonishing paradox&mdash;that even the legislators who voted for
the Glenn Bill have a much higher regard for the colored race and for
the A.M.A. schools than they formerly had. I cannot take time to explain
this singular phenomenon, but it is true. One of the prominent members
of the Georgia Legislature said to me on the streets of Macon, when he
heard the news of President Ware's sudden death at Atlanta University:
"Mr. Ware was a hero of the nineteenth century, and deserves a monument
to his memory from the State of Georgia." So, notwithstanding Col. Glenn
and his followers, the same Legislature of Georgia has recently added
two million dollars to the school fund of the State. The efforts of such
brave and fearless leaders as Rev. Dr. Haygood, Rev. Dr. Curry, Hon.
Walter B. Hill and others have not been in vain, and the good results of
the A.M.A. work have commanded respect and even wonder from its
bitterest opponents, whose number and zeal decreases. Wisdom and
discretion in future will rapidly increase its friends.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;I could say much more concerning the colored work, in which (at
Macon, Georgia) I spent eight and a half of the happiest years of my
life. That branch of work needs to be sustained and extended for years
to come. Having now been for eighteen months in the mountain white
department of work, and having visited nearly all its most important
posts, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>I am prepared to say that this, also, is a most needy part of the
great missionary work which this Society has undertaken. Here are nearly
two millions of people, scattered here and there over this great
Cumberland Plateau, who because of their inaccessibility, their poverty
and indifference, have been largely passed by until recently. The great
tides of missionary effort have swirled and risen to the east, the south
and the west, but have reached only a little way up into the caves and
valleys of this great island plateau, which towers a thousand feet above
the surrounding country. The inevitable effects of isolation, of
intermarriage, of stagnation and neglect in mental and spiritual
matters, has brought about a condition of things which calls for the aid
and sympathy of all good Samaritans. They have not suffered in the same
way as the colored race, from the former oppression and contagious vices
of a superior race; but left alone in their mountain fastnesses, left
behind in the march of human progress, they have been a nation of
Robinson Crusoes, deteriorating and retrograding from the inevitable
nature of mankind when left to itself. Having no momentum from outside,
feeling nothing of the swing and swell of progress, hearing little and
knowing little of the outer world, they need now our help to uplift and
enthuse and save them. Schools, churches, industrial instruction, mental
and spiritual training, help for the poor and the ignorant and the
degraded is sorely needed. This is comparatively a new field of work,
and is still largely unexplored and obscure. There is much to be done,
and it should be done now. The results of a very few years of work are
encouraging. Pray, friends, pray! Give, friends, give! Help, friends,
help!</p>

<h4>PROF. H.H. WRIGHT.</h4>

<p>I call your attention to the fact that the Board of Education of the
city of Nashville have extended the course of study in the public
schools for the colored population, so that there is in existence now a
fully-fledged High School for the colored youth, having precisely the
same course of study as that of the white youth; and the members of the
school are subjected to the same written and oral tests as those of the
white school. So far as I know, this is the first instance of the kind
in the South. Most boards <i>graduate</i> the colored children from the
eighth, or at most, the ninth year of school.</p>

<p>The colored High School of Nashville had public exercises in the Grand
Opera House in June, when a class of seven graduated. The Superintendent
of Public Schools, the Board of Education, and prominent citizens, white
and colored, occupied the platform and gave their approval of the
innovation by their presence.</p>

<p>The first class of the white High School was graduated twenty-eight
years ago and numbered seven. This class of colored graduates also
numbered seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>A member of that first white class is now the President of the Board of
Education, and presented the diplomas to the members of this colored
class. Altogether, the occasion was auspicious for better things in the
public school system in Tennessee.</p>

<p>One incident that has brightened our year is the arrival of a pretty
school organ, the generous gift of Mr. S.D. Smith, President of the
Smith Organ and Piano Company, Boston, Mass. It chanced that at the same
time, Mr. Hall, our Superintendent, came to visit us, and one morning
early we found him at work with his own hands removing it from its box.
On its being taken into the school-room where all the pupils were
assembled for the morning exercises, Mr. Hall in a felicitous manner
presented it to the school in Mr. Smith's name, taking from the children
in return a hearty "Thank you" for the donor, and a promise to make use
of the organ "in the cause of temperance and for the Lord Jesus Christ."
Then the first notes pealed forth from the sweet-toned organ, notes of
praise, accompanying the children's voices in the Gloria Patri. Then
holy hymns and temperance songs filled the air with melody.</p>

<p>The jubilee ended with grand old "America," and as we came to the
closing lines, how truly our hearts echoed the prayer:</p>

<h2><a name="VISIT_TO_PARK_STREET_CHURCH_STATION" id="VISIT_TO_PARK_STREET_CHURCH_STATION"></a>VISIT TO PARK STREET CHURCH STATION.</h2>

<h4>BY MRS. T.L. RIGGS.</h4>


<p>For a long time I have wished to see something of the people and of the
work at White River. The station there, Park Street Church Station,
so-called because the church of that name in Boston contributed the money
for its establishment, was almost the only one under Mr. Riggs's care
that I had not visited. Although the supervision of it, and of the whole
Rosebud Agency field, has recently been assumed by Mr. Cross, Mr. Riggs
continues to confer with him in regard to the management of it, and for
this purpose made a journey thither a few weeks ago. A happy combination
of circumstances at home made it possible for me to accompany him.</p>

<p>After three days of travel in pony-cart, we came in sight of the White
River, and before descending into the valley and crossing the river
caught a glimpse of the station building and the villages on the hills
near it. Climbing the hill at the rear of the station, we drove into the
yard, completely surprising Mr. Cross, who, nevertheless gave us a most
hearty welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>As soon as the news of our arrival had spread, we began to have
visitors, but, knowing that I should not see many of the people,
especially the older women, unless I went to their homes, I arranged
with Mr. Cross to take me to the different villages. We spent two days
in going about.</p>

<p>I should think there are between forty and fifty houses in the three
villages near there. In each of two houses, we found <i>three wives</i> and
ten children, and the others were well populated. All were in ignorance,
and filth, and degradation, pitiable to see. Some babies nearly a year
old had never been thoroughly washed since their birth. Some of the
older people had never been to the school-house. A few rather pride
themselves upon keeping aloof from the native teacher and the various
exercises he conducts. We were pleasantly received at all the places.
Some of the people had heard of "The Sacred Herald's" wife, though they
had never seen me.</p>

<p>Wishing to have all the women come to the school-house, that I might see
more of them and have them meet Virginia De Coteau, the teacher's wife,
we invited them to a feast. This is something the Dakotas are very fond
of, though usually it is connected with some of their dances or other
heathen customs. Some of the old women wished to know if I was going to
<i>preach</i> to them, evidently wanting to fight shy of anything of this
sort, but I told them no, it was to be a real feast, not a prayer
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Cross entered heartily into the preparations for the festivity. We
made about five gallons of coffee and the same quantity of stew,
consisting of meat, onions, turnips, beans, rice and crackers, with the
gravy well thickened&mdash;a very savory mess it was, too. We had crackers to
pass around. Not a very elaborate <i>menu</i>, but one which appealed
strongly to the Dakota taste.</p>

<p>By noon the women began to gather, and soon the school-room was well
filled, a good many sitting on the floor. There were about fifty
present, not counting little babies. There were only two painted faces,
though in our visiting there was scarcely a house in which there were
not two or more of the women painted; the most of them had washed their
faces and put on clean dresses.</p>

<p>I had told them all to bring their own dishes, and the variety was
amusing. There was everything in size from an ordinary cup to a milk-pan
and one much battered long-handled dipper. Coffee and crackers were
passed first, then the stew. "Oh, it smells of onions!" was the
exclamation as I dished it out. All seemed very happy, and laughed and
joked as they ate. I told them I had been ten years among the Dakotas
and had never before made a feast; that I had planned for a long time to
visit them and had not been able, and perhaps it would be a long time
before I should see them again, so I thought I would make them happy in
this way. The old women replied, "We have often heard of you, and now we
see you; we will always remember you and speak of you as 'the woman who
made the feast.'" After they had finished, I talked to them a little of
the "meat which perisheth not," and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>of the "Bread and the Water of
Life," closing with prayer. It was a very enjoyable experience. I also
met the women one afternoon at a special prayer meeting. It was not very
well attended on account of the storm, which was almost a blizzard on
that day. There are only two Christian women in that community besides
Louis' wife. We spent two Sundays with the intervening days at this
station, gaining a new insight into the needs of the out-station work,
and new inspiration for carrying it on.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One thing that interested me very much was seeing a little girl who was
a member of our Oahe School two years ago. She is the daughter of a
prominent man in the village near Park Street Church Station. She was in
native dress when she came to us; when I saw her over there, although
her mother was away at the Agency and she was staying with relatives,
she looked very neat and clean. She wore a pretty dress made after the
style worn in our school and in every respect looked as well as though
she had just come out of school. I think she would have returned with us
had her parents been at home.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There were two young women also, whom I should be glad to have in the
school here. They have just united with the church and been baptized.
They seem quite superior in many ways to their surroundings. They can
both read in Dakota and so have the Bible to learn from. Of course they
have in a manner isolated themselves from their youthful companions in
having given up their heathen customs; it seems as though souls so young
and untried in the Christian life must meet with many temptations and
many trying experiences. I should be glad to have them here in a
Christian community, where they could learn more of our Christian work.
I am sure they would gain help and strength from the prayer meetings and
missionary work, as well as from the sympathy of all who engage in such
work. Then, doubtless, they would be benefited by the industrial
training and the academic work, though I doubt if they would do much
with the English language, as they are both over twenty years old and
would probably not remain in school more than a year.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My journey has been a help to me. Living away from the people and losing
sight of the ignorance and filth and heathenism, we forget what our
chief aim should be, not simply school-work for the children, but
Christianization and civilization for the <i>masses</i>. This, in its
greatest effectiveness, can be done at the out-stations and in the
vernacular only. It is necessary to have the gospel preached constantly
in order to have it penetrate these darkened hearts, preached in a
tongue which can be understood, and necessary to have a Christian life
lived in its simplicity in their very midst. The native missionary's
family is an object-lesson of value not half appreciated by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>our Eastern
constituency. If, in addition to this, there is a white teacher to
uphold, support and push with Anglo-Saxon energy the efforts of the
native, the value of the out-station work is greatly increased. Would
that all could understand this fully!</p>

<p>It is helpful, too, to come home and see our Indian neighbors, who less
than fifteen years ago were in the same ignorant condition as those we
have just seen, now living as white people, earnest Christians, doing
much to help us in our work for their heathen relatives.</p>

<p>While you work for the schools, pray, also, for the work of the
out-stations; pray that the light may shine into the darkened hearts so
near us, pray that those who are living among them to teach them of the
Saviour of men may be granted wisdom and strength to teach and live
aright, that many souls may be won for Him whose servants we all are.</p>

<h2><a name="SAN_DIEGO_CHINESE_MISSION" id="SAN_DIEGO_CHINESE_MISSION"></a>SAN DIEGO CHINESE MISSION.</h2>

<h4>BY REV. J.B. SILCOX.</h4>

<p>The anniversary of the Congregational Chinese School at San Diego,
organized about six years ago, was held in the Congregational Church on
Sunday evening, February 10th. The church, capable of seating about five
hundred and fifty, was filled to its utmost capacity. There were about
thirty Chinese scholars present. The services were conducted by Rev. Dr.
Pond, who had come down from San Francisco for the purpose of visiting
the missions in Southern California. The pastor of the church, Rev. J.B.
Silcox, assisted in the opening services. The Chinese boys were
catechized by Dr. Pond, and showed by their answers that they were being
grounded in the fundamental truths of the Bible. Lum Goon Kee recited
the Twenty-third Psalm, and Chung Chong the Ten Commandments, and
another "The Apostles' Creed." The first and second commandments
received a new meaning to us as we heard them recited by one who until
recently bowed himself down to graven images of God and the devil in the
Joss house. They sang Christian hymns in Chinese and English. Charley
Nun gave an address in which he testified to the benefits in being "a
Jesus boy." Hom Gee had written and read the story of his conversion to
Jesus. It was interesting to listen as they told how they were led out
of darkness into light, and asked for the prayers of all good
Christians. The audience felt that human hearts are the same the world
over, and that the Holy Ghost had been given unto them, "even as unto
us." The address of Low Quong would convince the most skeptical of the
power of the gospel to purify the heart, illumine the mind and elevate
the life and character of the Chinamen <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>as well as others. He spoke in
good English, and by his clear putting of the gospel truth, touched the
hearts of all. The service made many converts. It convinced the hearers
that the Chinaman was made in the image of God and is included in the
"every creature," to whom the gospel is to be preached.</p>

<p>There are about one thousand Christian Chinamen connected with the
Congregational Churches of California and Oregon. They contribute about
$2,500 for home mission work and have organized a foreign missionary
society, and with $1,400 as a starter, have sent two missionaries, one a
Chinaman, back to China to do work there.</p>

<p>There is considerable opposition to Chinamen in this State. It does not
wholly arise from "sand lot" orators either. These "little brown men"
are industrious, patient, cheerful, obliging. They make the best of
servants. But the average working man of America cannot compete with him
in the labor market, and I would be sorry if he could. I hope the day
will never come when the working man of America will be reduced to such
cramped conditions of home life as "The heathen Chinee" luxuriates in.
Paganism can live where Christianity cannot. A hut will do for a pagan
Zulu. When he becomes a Christian, he wants a shirt and a house.
"Chinatown" in any California city, and especially in San Francisco,
where sixty or seventy thousand are housed and herded in a few blocks,
will open the eyes of Eastern men as to the wisdom of restricting
Chinese immigration. But there is no question as to our duty to those
that are here. We cannot afford to let them live and die in their
heathen vices. The best solution of the Chinese problem is to
Christianize those that are here. The best way to reach China with the
gospel is <i>via California</i>. Make Christians of these and they will
become missionaries to their brethren across the Pacific.</p>

<h2><a name="TEMPERANCE_WORK_IN_TENNESSEE" id="TEMPERANCE_WORK_IN_TENNESSEE"></a>TEMPERANCE WORK IN TENNESSEE.</h2>

<p>I have been working in this State for three years, giving mothers new
ideas, making them think in their log cabins, and causing many to say,
"You have done me good." I am now on the Cumberland Plateau with my
husband, who is in the employ of the American Missionary Association. A
few weeks ago, I went with him to a mining town to assist him and
Brother Pope in a series of meetings. There were early indications of
popular interest, the crowd was easily gathered and the good work began
much sooner than the most sanguine anticipated. The first week passed.
Sinners had risen for prayers, strong men bowed their heads, confessing
their sins, and conversions were daily reported. Then came a momentary
lull, such as is often observed in revival seasons. Mr. Pope's
experienced eye was quick to divine the cause. He knew that crowd of
eager listeners&mdash;that there were many among them, old and young, who
stood on the verge of the Kingdom with the fatal cup in their hands.
Said he to me, "The time has come for a temperance talk&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>that is what
they need!" and designated that very evening for me to present the
subject.</p>

<p>At this I confess I was not a little embarrassed, for although
accustomed to short, informal temperance talks in public, I had no idea,
woman that I was, of taking his place at such a critical moment. What
added to my embarrassment was the disheartening fact to all of us that
Mr. Pope was just then unexpectedly called away to another part of his
extensive field and was gone two days. So there was no help for it. I
looked over my old notes&mdash;nothing would do. Then I inquired of the Lord,
and He said "Fear not." Here let me remark, that I have hitherto
encountered in this needy part of the country an obstinate prejudice
against this "Woman's Temperance Work" by the women themselves, the most
interested party in it. But here, thanks be to God, I met a most
favorable reception. How the people looked, how earnestly they listened
also, yes, and wept, as I told them of the world-wide Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, and warned them of that fatal sin which was keeping
many women out of the Kingdom of Heaven, and they knew it. I talked in
my simple way of human love in its various phases, and then turned to
the incomparable love of Christ, who would save them if they would only
let him. In conclusion I asked&mdash;"Is there any one here, man, woman or
child, in this congregation, who is willing to forswear the intoxicating
cup henceforth and forever? If there is, let him come forward and take
me by the hand." With scarcely a pause, the main body of the audience
<i>in the rear</i> (you know what that means) rose from their seats and
literally precipitated themselves upon the speaker's stand. For the next
half hour I had nothing to do but to shake hands and pin the white
ribbon. I never witnessed a more exciting scene. The tearful joy of
suffering wives over their sobered husbands, and anxious parents over
their wandering boys will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>The happy result of this first meeting of the kind created a demand for
its repetition on two other occasions, as the revival went on with equal
enthusiasm and success. In the course of our visitation from house to
house, a Northern lady who had come down here to winter with her brother
on account of her health, informed me of the disgusting revels of a
certain man and his wife with their half-dozen drunken boarders, which
she was compelled to witness in the other end of the house weekly, or as
often as pay-day came around. "I can't bear it," said she. "Are you then
praying," said I; "Where is your faith?" A few day's later, at the
mother's meeting, another woman said, with much feeling, "Won't you
present the temperance cause again tonight? My husband and several
others wish to join your organization." I did. And who were the first to
present themselves as candidates for the white ribbon but that same
woman and her husband? Twenty-three others in the congregation followed
suit, and all again stood forth hand in hand&mdash;token of unbroken
friendship&mdash;a spectacle to angels and mortal man. By this time, to our
great joy, Brother Pope had returned, and he assigned me to my proper
place after one of his own rousing appeals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>To give you a general idea of the power of this work, which continued
with unflagging interest to the last, allow me to cite two or three
instances of conversion. One, a man who had shot and killed three
notorious burglars, was tried for legal informality and acquitted on the
ground of the public weal. This was two years ago, and the people who
knew and understood him well, said that he had enjoyed no peace of mind
since. Notwithstanding all, he was, and is, a man of power and
commanding influence, and has entered heartily into the work and
interests of the A.M.A., as Brother Pope can assure you. Another, a
younger man, likewise implicated in a murder last Fourth of July, and
committed to jail for a time, the particulars of whose case I am
unacquainted with, cried out in open congregation, "Pray for me, I am
the vilest sinner that ever lived," and dropped upon his knees in sore
agony of body and soul to join in prayer with the Christians present. As
the latter arose and began singing, "Come, humble sinner," he stepped
right forward exclaiming, "By the grace of God I will, I will," and at
that moment the great change might be read in the heavenly expression of
his changed countenance. Yet another young man, a boon companion in sin,
cried out in the same way and came forward kneeling for some time, and
then rising said, "I have found God; he is good; come, my friends, and
find him, O come," repeating these words as he passed through the
wondering congregation till he came to me, when grasping my hand, he
exclaimed, "Praise the Lord that ever he sent you to this place." He was
asked to pray. "Yes, yes," was his instant reply, "that is just what I
want to do;" and such a prayer as he offered up is seldom heard. A
well-known skeptic arose and openly renounced his infidelity.</p>

<p>As my husband and Brother Pope had both their special appointments
elsewhere to fill, it fell to my lot, much against my predilections, to
close the whole series of meetings by my third and last temperance
lecture. This appeal on the temperance question was also responded to,
at first mostly by young boys and girls, followed by a venerable
gentleman and his two sons, and then the full complement of men and
women. So all discouragements of the past are forgotten in these
glorious results.</p>

<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS_AT_THE_SKOKOMISH_RESERVATION" id="CHRISTMAS_AT_THE_SKOKOMISH_RESERVATION"></a>CHRISTMAS AT THE S'KOKOMISH RESERVATION.</h2>

<h4>BY REV. MYRON EELLS.</h4>

<p>Our Christmas passed off very pleasantly, with a tree and appropriate
exercises in the evening. The church was full, with the school children,
about forty-five in number, the older Indians, government employees, and
a number of surrounding whites. Two songs were sung by the whole school,
one being an original piece beginning with the words, "We're from
Squakson and S'kokomish," (the two reservations from which the children
have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>come,) and containing the names of all the children in school. The
other, "Hurrah for the Christmas Tree" was sung just before the gifts
were distributed. There were other songs by the older pupils, the
youngest children closing with the clapping of their hands. Two Indian
girls played the organ. Nine little girls recited a hymn, each one
beginning with the successive letters of the word Christmas, and as they
did so, those letters were hung up between them and the audience. Ten
little boys recited a poem on temperance, in connection with which the
Indian policeman, recently appointed, made some earnest remarks on the
same subject. It was his first effort in church, and he surprised his
friends by his success. An Indian chief spoke about Christmas, and your
missionary added remarks on the meaning of the word Christmas&mdash;the feast
of Christ.</p>

<p>A report of the Sabbath-school showed that there had been an average
attendance of forty-five. Prizes having been offered to all those who
should be on the roll of honor four-fifths of the time, by learning the
Sabbath School lesson&mdash;three verses in advance and three in review&mdash;
perfectly, it was found that five had gained a prize, a good book each,
two of them being Indian children, and the others white children.</p>

<p>The gifts from the tree were then distributed. None of the children were
omitted; some went home so loaded that they could hardly carry all, and
even many of the oldest, decrepit Indians who could not be present, were
not forgotten.</p>

<p>A violin and organ solo by the school teacher and his wife called the
audience again to order, and an exhibition followed with a small magic
lantern and about eighty pictures, Bible, temperance and comic. This I
have used in my tours with the Indians, and it is always acceptable. The
remark was made more than once, "How well the children performed their
parts."</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
